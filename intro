Introduction to MySQL
MySQL is one of the most popular Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) used for storing, managing, and retrieving data efficiently. It's open-source and widely used in web applications, data analysis, and various other domains.

What is a Database?
A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. In MySQL, databases are used to store data in tables.

Key Features of MySQL
Relational Database: Data is organized in tables with rows and columns.
SQL Support: Uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to interact with the database.
Open-Source: Free to use and has a large community.
Cross-Platform: Runs on various operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS.
Scalability: Supports both small applications and large-scale data systems.
Security: Provides strong data protection mechanisms.
