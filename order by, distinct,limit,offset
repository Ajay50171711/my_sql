1. ORDER BY
Used to sort the results in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order based on one or more columns.

Example: List all products sorted by price in descending order.
SELECT * 
FROM Products
ORDER BY Price DESC;


2. DISTINCT
Used to return unique values from a column, eliminating duplicates.

Example: Get a list of unique product categories.
SELECT DISTINCT Category
FROM Products;


3. LIMIT
Used to restrict the number of rows returned.

Example: Get the top 5 most expensive products.
SELECT * 
FROM Products
ORDER BY Price DESC
LIMIT 5;


4. OFFSET
Used to skip a specific number of rows before starting to return rows. Often used with LIMIT.

Example: Get the 6th to 10th most expensive products.
SELECT * 
FROM Products
ORDER BY Price DESC
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5;
