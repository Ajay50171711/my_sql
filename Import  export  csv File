How to Export and Import Data Using MySQL Workbench


Export Data from MySQL Workbench to Excel (CSV)
---------------------------------------------------
Run your query to get the result grid with the data you want to export.

In the result grid panel, click on the Export button (usually an icon with a disk or export symbol).

Choose the file format (e.g., CSV or Excel) and select the destination folder where you want to save the exported file.

Click Save or Export.

After the export finishes, open the exported file in Excel or your preferred spreadsheet application.



Import Data from CSV into MySQL Workbench
-----------------------------------------------------
In the Navigator panel on the left, expand your database/schema.

Right-click on the Tables section or anywhere inside your database schema.

Select Table Data Import Wizard from the context menu.

In the wizard, browse and select your CSV file to import.

Choose to either:

Import data into an existing table, or

Create a new table (MySQL Workbench will automatically generate a table based on your CSVâ€™s columns).

Review and adjust the table name and column data types if needed.

Proceed with the import by clicking Next and then Finish.

Once complete, your data will be imported into the selected table.
